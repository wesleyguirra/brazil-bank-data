# Brazil Bank Data Repository

Welcome to the Brazil Bank Data Repository! This project emerged from the challenges we faced in sourcing reliable Brazil bank data. Existing information was scattered, inconsistent, and often outdated, making the process time-consuming. In response, we've created this repository to provide a centralized, up-to-date, and trustworthy source of Brazil bank data, including logos, COMPE codes, and bank names. Your contributions can help build a comprehensive resource that saves others from the same struggles we encountered during our data collection efforts.
